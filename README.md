#### This is my solution to the counting smileys challenge on codewars

##### The solution is a function that counts the number of valid smileys in the passed arr
##### A valid smiley is one that

* must start with a two eyes (:) or winked eyes (;)

* may have a nose - a valid nose is (-) or (~)

* must have a smiling mouth ()) or 'D'
